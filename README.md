DominoTropicalXNA
=================

Domino board game using Microsoft XNA 4.0. The game was done for a programming course in PUCMM University in the Dominican Repubic, therefore, the game text (and perhaps some code) is in spanish.

The game is half finished and will not play a second round, unless the randomly picked domino happens to be a double.
